 * should be world because "before" is 6 letters long, and "hello" and "world" are both 5,
 * but the output should be world because it appeared as the last 5-letter word in the array.
 * ---
 * If strArr was ["hello", "world", "after", "all"] the output should
 * be after because the first three words are all 5 letters long, so return the last one.
 * The array will have at least three strings and each string will only contain letters.
